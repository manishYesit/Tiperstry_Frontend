  "faqkey1": "What is Tipestry?",
  "faqbody1": "Tipestry is a web annotation platform that lets people leave comments on any webpage or at any geographical location. Posts can be viewed through tipestry.com, the Tipestry browser add-on, or through augmented reality with the Tipestry Go app. Tipestry also features built-in cryptocurrency tipping, allowing people to monetize their posts or websites without having to pay high fees, give up personal information, or worry about being deplatformed.",
  "faqkey2": "How is Tipestry different than other crypto social media platforms?",
  "faqbody2": "First, Tipestry is blockchain agnostic, meaning you can tip and earn many different types of cryptocurrencies. Second, Tipestry is more than a social media site - it's also a universal commenting and tipping system that adds a meta layer on top of the entire web where people can interact and earn money anywhere online.",
  "faqkey3": "How does Tipestry.com work?",
  "faqbody3": "In the URL field on the top right of the screen, enter the address of the website you want to discuss and a comment section will load for that page. You can also check out what people around the web are currently talking about on the Trending section of the Tipestry homepage.",
  "faqkey4": "What is tipping?",
  "faqbody4": "Tipping is a way to show other users you appreciate their content. It’s a more powerful version of a like or an upvote, as it involves automatically sending cryptocurrency to the user you’re tipping. To tip someone, click on the Give Coins button next to their post and choose the type of coin and the amount you want to tip. An icon showing the tip will then show up next to their post and they will receive the coins in their account.",
  "faqkey5": "What is cryptocurrency?",
  "faqbody5": "Cryptocurrency is peer-to-peer digital money. It has several advantages over tradition currency, one of which is that it is much easier to send and receive online and across borders. Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency, was created by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. Since then, thousands of other coins and tokens with different features have been created.",
  "faqkey6": "What are some use cases?",
  "faqbody6-1": "Find out what people are saying about a particular website. Is the site legitimate, is it a scam, is its information up to date, is it fake news? Sometimes it’s hard to tell based just on a site’ s content or its search engine rankings. A quick look at what other people are saying can serve as a helpful guide.",
  "faqbody6-2": "Discuss sites where the comment sections have been removed. Many major news organizations have removed their comment sections in recent years. The justification often used is that the quality of the comments is generally too low to justify the cost of hosting them and although that might be true in some cases, it also conveniently prevents readers from voicing contrary opinions.",
  "faqbody6-3": "Discuss topics where there’s no obvious place to do so. For example, If I wanted to share my thoughts on rutabagas, but there’ s no message board dedicated to that the subject in my language, I can enter www.rutabagas.com https: //tipestry.com/www.rutabagas.com on Tipestry and talk about it there.",
  "faqbody6-4": "Discuss very specific topics. After watching a movie, you can sometimes find a forum to discuss it (although now with IMDB shutting down its message boards, even that can be difficult). However, what if you want to discuss a specific episode or a specific song? With Tipestry you could go on the Wikipedia page or summary for a particular episode or the lyrics page for a particular song and discuss is there.",
  "faqbody6-5": "Find and share information about new product releases. For example, when the software is updated and you encounter a bug, it’s often difficult to sift through years of forum posts about that software to find a discussion relevant to your problem. Going to that software’ s homepage through Tipestry is a way to find the latest and most relevant discussion.",
  "faqkey7": "How does moderation work?",
  "faqbody7": "Moderation is an unfortunate necessity on sites that allow user-generated content. As important as free speech is, having no rules is impractical on a platform like Tipestry due to bad actors. Spam, illegal content (threats of violence, libel, etc.) and doxing all require moderation. What the exact rules are, however, is never easy to decide. Rather than leave it up to us alone, our plan is to use blockchain to allow the community to transparently vote on moderation policies and elect moderators. Additionally, instead of relying on unpaid moderators to work out of the goodness of their hearts (or in order to put themselves in a position where they can push an agenda), elected moderators can be compensated for their efforts with cryptocurrency.",
  "faqkey8": "What is the point of tipping?",
  "faqbody8": "Traditional social media companies rely on their users to generate most of the value on their platforms. Then typically show their gratitude by selling their users’ personal information to third party corporations and government agencies. This model is unfair and is due for a change. Tipestry’s built-in cryptocurrency tipping is one way to address the problem. If someone posts something valuable, they can receive tips from us and from other users, allowing contributors to the platform to earn rewards for the value they create. Cryptocurrency also provides avenues for us  (such as issuing our own tokens) to cover the costs of running the platform while respecting users’ privacy.",
  "faqkey9": "How can I send feedback?",
  "faqbody9": "Please send any comments, bug reports, abuse complaints, or questions to ",
  "faqkey10": "What is Tipestry’s view on privacy?",
  "faqbody10": "One of the main purposes of Tipestry is to create a business model for social media that respects user's privacy, which is one of the reasons cryptocurrency is built into the platform. Cryptocurrency is good for privacy for two reasons: first, it allows people to send and receive money without giving up personal information through a credit card or bank account, and second, it creates an opportunity for us to cover our costs without resorting to invasive advertising.",
